# Recursion and Backtracking

Recursion is a process to something calling itself. This applies in real life as well as in programming. In programming this is implemented via functions **that call themselves over and over**. Each recurrence (the recursion polynomial equation) specifies the recurring case as well as the base case which ends the recursion at any point of runtime.

Backtracking is a similar thing but with a different essence.
