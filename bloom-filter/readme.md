# Bloom Filter

Implemented in Python 3.7.

- The price we pay for efficiency through bloom filters is that it is probabilistic in nature that means, there might be some **_False Positive_** results. False positive means, it might tell that given username is already taken but actually itâ€™s not.
- Not being **_False Negative_** such that telling that username doesn't exist while it is there, i.e., if exists it reports it's existenece in terms of maybe, else if not present it is 100% confident to report the same.
- Deleting elements from filter is not possible because, if we delete a single element by clearing bits at indices generated by k hash functions, it might cause deletion of few other elements.
