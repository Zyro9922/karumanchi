# Hashing

Some issues have been discovered in the source codes - like:

* array-matching: returns `1` when all elements of array `b` are same and belong of anyone of `a[]`.
* two-arrays: drop the complexity to max(n, m) i.e., linear.
* delete-array: optimise to lower the time complexity and it doesn't works.
