# Chapter 8 - Disjoint Sets ADT

* An equivalence relation is Reflexive, Symmetric and Transitive.
* In Path Compression, from the node to find it's root element all traversed nodes are re-aligned to the root directly as their parent node. Since, in `union_by_height()`, the height is manipluated to unionize the two sets/trees, which can be performed with this method of finding the set as their is no efficient way to do so.
